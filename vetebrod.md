### Filling
#### Ingredients
- 200g of marzipan of approx 25% almond paste
- 60g of sugar ~ 6 tbsp or 90 mL
- 18g of ground cardamom ~ 6 and 1/2 tsp 

#### Method
1. finely grind up 18g of cardamom, I've got a pepper mill dedicated just to cardamom for this
2. combine with the 80g of sugar in a container larger than a your grater.

   _Note: if you are using a marzipan with a higher almond paste % increase the sugar balance. Maybe 100g or 120g for a 50% paste._
3. grate the 200g of marzipan into the container containing the sugar and cardamom.
    The key is to use the sugar and cardamom to prevent the marzipan from sticking back to itself again.

### Dough 
#### Ingredients
- 150g Butter ~ 165 mL or 11 tbsp
- 135g of sugar ~ 150 mL or 10 tbsp
- 500 mL of milk
- 2 packets of active dry yeast
- 1/2 tsp of Salt
- 8g of ground cardamom ~ 3 tsp or 1 tbsp
- roughly 900g of flour

#### Method
1. Warm milk to 37°C 

    _Note: there are many ways to do this, but too hot will kill the yeast. I heat it in a container inside a water bath maintained at 37°C by my sous vide cooker._ 

2. Add 5mL / 1 tsp of sugar to it
3. Add 2 packets (8g each) of active dry yeast to milk and let sit for **10 minutes**

    _A foam should build up on the surface._
4. Grind up the cardamom, it does not need to be as fine as the cardamom in the filling.
5. Add 130g of sugar, all 8g of cardamom, 1/2 tsp of salt, and the 1/2 L of milk w. yeast to the mixing bowl.
6. Melt the 150g of butter and add it to the bowl.
7. Optional: briefly turn on the oven to create a **warm**, not hot, place for the dough to rise
8. Add flour gradually to mixing bowl stopping when the dough stops sticking to the sides (save some for your working surface)
9. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 40 minutes
10. Punch dough down and quarter it.

### Finishing
#### Ingredients
- Filling from above
- Dough from above, quartered
- Pearl Sugar or similar for decoration
- 1-2 Eggs for egg wash
- 120 mL of butter ~ 1/2 cup or 115g

**Egg Wash**
Separate the yokes of the egg from the whites and put in container. Whisk until broken up and optionally add a small amount of milk.
The more dilute the egg wash the lighter its colour when baked.

**Repeat the following 4x**
1. Roll the dough into a rectangle roughly the size of an A4 / Letter sheet of paper
2. Lightly melt and spread 1/4 of the butter (30mL, 29g, 1/8 cup) over the rectangle of dough.
3. Sprinkle 1/4 of the filling over top (probably 70g but check. There's always some marzipan lost when grating)
4. Roll tightly (think yule log) from either of the shorter edges of the rectangle
5. Place on baking tray and using scissors cut from above 90% of the way through 10 times down the length of the roll.
    _Leave each end in the middle and then as you go down the length push each nearly separate puck to either side alternating._
6. Let sit for ~30 minutes to rise again.
8. Set the oven for 365°F or 185°C 
7. Apply egg wash and sprinkle the pearl sugar on top.
8. Bake for 20 minutes.

    _Note: I normally bake 2 at a time following the steps above in parallel_

**Alternative Baking:**
Instead, cut the rolls all the way through creating cinnamon roll like shapes and bake these at 425°F or 220°C for 8-12 minutes.
