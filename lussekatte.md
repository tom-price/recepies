## Shopping List
- 670-740g of all purpose un-bleached flour 
- 2/3 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of water
- 125g of sugar ~ 158mL
- 108g Butter ~ 118 mL or 1/2 cup (maybe a bit more)

## Dough
- milk
- water
- yeast
- 120g in dough, 5g in milk

#### Method
1. Warm milk to 37°C 

    Note: there are many ways to do this, but too hot will kill the yeast. I heat it in a container inside a water bath maintained at 37°C by my sous vide cooker._ 

2. Add 5mL / 1 tsp of sugar to it
3. Add 2 packets (8g each) of active dry yeast to milk and let sit for **10 minutes**

    A foam should build up on the surface._
    
4. Add sugar, butter, eggs, salt, cardamom, and orange peel
